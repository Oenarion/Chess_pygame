# Chess_pygame
This repository was created to emulate the game of chess with pygames, a python library which can be easily installed.

# Disclaimer
This games differs a bit from normal chess.

In this version of chess a player wins when he eats the enemy king, so checkmate or checks are not implemented.

Also for this reason castle can be done whatever the player likes it (of course if the cells between king and rook are free and both pieces has ever moved), meaning that if the cell in which the king will end after castle is under attack you can still perform the movement at your own risk.
